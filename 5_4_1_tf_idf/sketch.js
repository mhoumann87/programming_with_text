  The td-idf stands for  term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency. It is a word counting algorithm
  but instead of just counting the words (how many times does a term show up in a text), hold up against the
  frequency af a word in other documents. 
  
  First we count the words in a document, then we compare this count with other documents, and if a word
  is frequent in these as well, the word gets a low score.
  
  It is a way to find keywords that are "unique" for this document.
