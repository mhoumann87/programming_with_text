/*
  In an associative array we are working with keys and value pairs, witch makes it ideal
  for working with counting.
  {
    "happy": 3,
  }
  Where happy are the word(key) and 3 are the number of times the word is used in the text (value).

  It is easy to see that this is "just" a javascript object, or a JSON file.
