    <h1>Diastic Machine</h1>
    <p>
      This page takes inspiration from
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Mac_Low"
        target="_blank"

        >Jackson Mac Low</a
      >'s Diastic Technique.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple explanation, if possible, of the technique, requires a lengthy
      text and a seed phrase like this:
    </p>

    <p>Base text:</p>
    <figure>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68366">
        <p>
          Doomed to pleasant disappointment, however, were such good folks of
          Shorehaven as anticipated any spectacular ill-conduct that evening on
          the part of the returned crew. Before the rope fender of the
          despicable “Jane Gladys” had rubbed the sides of the quay for five
          minutes, an atmosphere of heavy gloom had settled upon the hardy
          mariners who peopled her, and this though they had arrived in port in
          the best of spirits, and were, moreover, furnished with several
          half-formulated plans of campaign which only awaited the inspiration
          of environment to touch success in the form of financial or liquid
          bonuses.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

    <p>Then we need a seed phrase, we'll take an easy one: "cat".</p>

    <p>
      Now we read the base text, and find the first word starting with 'c',
      crew. Then we start over and find the first word with 'a' as second
      letter, part. And start again with 't' as third letter, anticipated.
    </p>

    <p>And now we have our "poem": Crew part anticipated.</p>

    <p>
      Can be done like this, the good old fashioned way, but we have a computer,
      so why not use that.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can supply your own base text, dropping it in the page, or use the one
      we have supplied, chapter one of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
    </p>

    <p>
      You also have to provide a seed phrase, by writing is in the input field.
    </p>

    <label for="seed-phrase"
      >Please input your seed phrase:
      <input type="text" name="seed-phrase" id="seed-phrase" />
